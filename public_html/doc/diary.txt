DAY 1

We start the design of the test. Given the fact that the OMBD API is quite easy to use,
the objectives are:

- Design a SPA that can use the HTML5 Local Storage API to store the data that
the user will consume while using the application. This app is the CLIENT. As such,
it will be able to consume several data origins being theses the following:
    
    - OMBD API (in raw / debug mode)
    - Wrapper API for OMBD API (pure jQuery)
    - Wrapper JSON API for OMDB API (a backend server with connection to SQL)

- The application must be usable in a desktop, tablet, and mobile environment.
Responsiveness is a must-have.

The tools used for the project, as of now, are jQuery and HTML5. LetÂ´s start to
learn consuming the OMBD API.
