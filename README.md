#APPLICATION

The application is already online, if anyone wants to see it. I will keep on updating it until the
day of the test, but i want to host it and start testing in remote too. I used a free hosting:

Enjoy :-)

#INSTRUCTIONS

In the field "Series", insert the name of the series you want to scan.
Examples (Tested): Game of thrones, True detective, Walking dead, Vikings.
Note: Some series will return abnormal results. Try "I, Claudius"

In the field "Temporadas", insert the number of seasons to scan for
In the fields "Episodios", insert the number of episodes to scan for

Note: If ((Temporadas * Episodios) > 40) it can take some time. 
Sometimes the OMDB API gets slow, and sometimes it goes fast. It does
not seem to have any bearing on the code, but more requests will clog 
the OMDB server request queue.

After the scanning is complete, you will have the list of episodes
for the entire series, if you scanned enough. On clicking any of
them, you can see the plot, a combo to rate it, and...
... a little surprise. :-D
