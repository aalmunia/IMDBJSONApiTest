DAY 1

We start the design of the test. Given the fact that the OMBD API is quite easy to use,
the objectives are:

- Design a SPA that can use the HTML5 Local Storage API to store the data that
the user will consume while using the application. This app is the CLIENT. As such,
it will be able to consume several data origins being theses the following:
    
    - OMBD API (in raw / debug mode)
    - Wrapper API for OMBD API (pure jQuery)
    - Wrapper JSON API for OMDB API (a backend server with connection to SQL)

- The application must be usable in a desktop, tablet, and mobile environment.
Responsiveness is a must-have.

The tools used for the project, as of now, are jQuery and HTML5. LetÂ´s start to
learn consuming the OMBD API.

DAY 1, LATER

Finished the API for consuming data. It needs more refactoring, but how it works is
understood. Also, i added a nice functionality to scan a series, to find out
how many seasons and episodes does it have. Added the functional test, this is the
app template, after i implement bootstrap in it.

TODO (tomorrow):

    - Implement Bootstrap 3 for the view
    - Implement Bootstrap Table for the showing of tabular data
