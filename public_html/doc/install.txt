In order to install the application, you need:

- A web server of any kind. The client is pure HTML + JS, but it needs to run in
127.0.0.1 (or other server), because of AJAX problems in cross domain, if run from
file:/// protocol. Make the server return the page index.html. Enjoy :-D

The libraries and / or technologies used in this demo application are:

- HTML5
- jQuery / pure JS
- Bootstrap 3
- Bootstrap Table (http://bootstrap-table.wenzhixin.net.cn/), a plugin for
bootstrap that allows easy to use grids. I used this because i have already
worked with it. Other libraries considered were:

        jQuery EasyUI (http://www.jeasyui.com/)
        Datatables (https://www.datatables.net/manual/styling/bootstrap)

But i sticked with this one because i really like the work the developer has
done.

- OMDB API
- YouTube API
- Node.js
- MySQL
